LSTM - Linear Regression Model For Predicting Corn Yields

Using LSTMs for day 1 onwards predictions of corn yield by predicting Vegatation Index.

Using LSTMs allows us to make continuous predictions from day 1, till the harvest, with predictions would get better closer to harvest.

US_Total_yield - 

Data for the total yield in the US/year in BU/Acre - this was added to the original dataset to provide information about yield

US_data_modified - 

Contains the original dataset augmented with the yield value for each year, and some other fields that are used in the model
